I've learned a lot of new things while I am starting to practice the workshop1. I found out programming is not so much easy like what I have imagined. We have to be more detailed, more responsible, and more knowledable about writing coding, and get to know each programming languages,such as C++, Java, python...For me, it seems like, I started riding bycle with "never give up" mind set.
